            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I’m an economist and water security, sanitation, and hygiene specialist with experience in the design, technical delivery, and management of USAID water security, sanitation, and hygiene (WSSH) programs in 20+ countries across Africa, LAC, and Asia. 
               I specialize in infrastructure advisory and capital investment planning for major water supply projects in emerging markets.</p>
            <p>I'm currently on a professional break through July 2025. 
                Most days, you can catch me working on outdoor education and citizen science programs focused on sustainable food access and river conservation with some amazing folks at Chicago's 
                <a href="https://www.greencitymarket.org/what-we-do/educating-our-community">Green City Market</a>, 
                <a href="https://urbanrivers.org/">Urban Rivers</a>, and 
                <a href="https://www.chicagoriver.org/">Friends of the Chicago River</a>. 
                I'm also working on a blog about the history of the Chicago River.</p>
            <h2>Work History</h2>
            <p>I previously worked at <a href="https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/environment-solutions/water-and-sanitation-services-and-resource-management">DAI</a> and <a href="https://www.tetratech.com/solutions/international-development/water-security-sanitation-and-hygiene/">Tetra Tech</a> on several USAID-funded WSSH programs, including:<a href="https://www.globalwaters.org/HowWeWork/Activities/philippines-safe-water"> USAID/Philippines Safe Water</a>, <a href="https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/el-salvador-water-services-project-wsp"> USAID/El Salvador Water Services Project (WSP)</a>, <a href="https://www.globalwaters.org/wash-fin"> USAID Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene Finance (WASH-FIN)</a>, <a href="https://www.globalwaters.org/HowWeWork/Activities/uganda-sanitation-health-activity"> USAID/Uganda Sanitation for Health Activity (USHA)</a>, and <a href="https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/haiti-usaid-water-and-sanitation-watsan"> USAID/Haiti Eau</a>.
            <p>I was the Project Analyst for <a href="https://www.globalwaters.org/wash-fin-2"> USAID Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene Finance (WASH-FIN) 2</a>, where I led data analytics, monitoring, and impact evaluation efforts for a $73M program operating in India, Kenya, and Ghana to mobilize financing for climate resilient water and sanitation services.</p> 
            <p>I additionally am an independent data science and project finance consultant to donor and government clients on a variety of water, biodiversity, and climate adaptation programs, including: <a href="https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/africa-trade-and-investment-ati-activity"> USAID Africa Trade & Investment</a>, <a href="https://www.globalwaters.org/HowWeWork/Activities/usaid-fragile-waters-activity"> USAID Fragile Waters</a>, <a href="https://www.gcbc.org.uk/"> UK Global Centre on Biodiversity for Climate</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockblue.org/acorn/"> ROCKBlue's Access to Capital, Oversight and Reporting Nexus (ACORN).</a><p>I have a master’s degree in Data, Economics, and Development Policy from MIT, and an undergraduate degree in Business Honors & Plan II from the University of Texas at Austin. </p>
            <p>You can see more of the places where I've worked on this <a href="https://neildpatel.github.io/map.html">map</a></p>
            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>My research primarily focuses on the use of geospatial AI to monitor, target, and sustain safe and reliable water and sanitation services in rapidly-expanding urban areas and informal settlements. I was a research affiliate with the <a href="https://senseable.mit.edu/">MIT Senseable City Lab</a> and <a href="https://d-lab.mit.edu/">MIT D-Lab</a>, working on projects ranging from designing a sensor system to monitor vermifilter wastewater treatment systems in rural Colombia to developing deep learning models trained to detect and geo-reference informal water infrastructure using street-level imagery in Nigeria and the Philippines.</p>
            <p>You can learn more about my research projects on this <a href="https://neildpatel.github.io/research.html">page</a>.
            <h2>Groundwater Youth Network</h2>
            <p>I helped found <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/unesco-groundwater-youth-network">UNESCO’s Groundwater Youth Network</a> as a member of the inaugural steering committee, supporting research, career development, and capacity-building programs for a body of 2,000+ young water professionals representing 115+ countries. I have advocated for youth inclusion in the Sustainable Development Goals at the United Nations’ General Assembly and the High-Level Political Forum for Sustainable Development.</p>
