            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I’m an economist and water security, sanitation, and hygiene specialist with experience in the design, technical delivery, and management of water security, sanitation, and hygiene (WSSH) programs in 20+ countries across Africa, LAC, and Asia. I currently work for <a href="https://castalia-advisors.com/">Castalia Advisors</a> as a Senior Analyst in the Water Practice, where I specialize in infrastructure advisory and capital investment planning for major water supply projects in emerging markets.</p>
            <p>Outside of work, you can catch me working on outdoor education and citizen science programs focused on sustainable food access and river conservation with some amazing folks at Chicago's 
                <a href="https://www.greencitymarket.org/what-we-do/educating-our-community">Green City Market</a>, 
                <a href="https://urbanrivers.org/">Urban Rivers</a>, and 
                <a href="https://www.chicagoriver.org/">Friends of the Chicago River</a>. 
                I also write <a href="https://riverinreverse.substack.com/">River in Reverse </a> – a Substack about the cultural history of the Chicago River, and more broadly exploring innovative approaches to designing equitable, climate-resilient, and ecologically vibrant cities.</p>
            <h2>Work History</h2>
            <p>I previously worked at <a href="https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/environment-solutions/water-and-sanitation-services-and-resource-management">DAI</a> and <a href="https://www.tetratech.com/solutions/international-development/water-security-sanitation-and-hygiene/">Tetra Tech</a> on several USAID-funded WSSH programs, including:<a href="https://www.globalwaters.org/HowWeWork/Activities/philippines-safe-water"> USAID/Philippines Safe Water</a>, <a href="https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/el-salvador-water-services-project-wsp"> USAID/El Salvador Water Services Project (WSP)</a>, <a href="https://www.globalwaters.org/wash-fin"> USAID Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene Finance (WASH-FIN)</a>, <a href="https://www.globalwaters.org/HowWeWork/Activities/uganda-sanitation-health-activity"> USAID/Uganda Sanitation for Health Activity (USHA)</a>, and <a href="https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/haiti-usaid-water-and-sanitation-watsan"> USAID/Haiti Eau</a>.
            <p>I was the Project Analyst for <a href="https://www.globalwaters.org/wash-fin-2"> USAID Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene Finance (WASH-FIN) 2</a>, where I led data analytics, monitoring, and impact evaluation efforts for a $73M program operating in India, Kenya, and Ghana to mobilize financing for climate resilient water and sanitation services.</p> 
            <p>I additionally am an independent data science and project finance consultant to donor and government clients on a variety of water, biodiversity, and climate adaptation programs, including: <a href="https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/africa-trade-and-investment-ati-activity"> USAID Africa Trade & Investment</a>, <a href="https://www.globalwaters.org/HowWeWork/Activities/usaid-fragile-waters-activity"> USAID Fragile Waters</a>, <a href="https://www.gcbc.org.uk/"> UK Global Centre on Biodiversity for Climate</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockblue.org/acorn/"> ROCKBlue's Access to Capital, Oversight and Reporting Nexus (ACORN).</a><p>I have a master’s degree in Data, Economics, and Development Policy from MIT, and an undergraduate degree in Business Honors & Plan II from the University of Texas at Austin. </p>

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>My research primarily focuses on the use of geospatial AI to monitor, target, and sustain safe and reliable water and sanitation services in rapidly-expanding urban areas and informal settlements. I was a research affiliate with the <a href="https://senseable.mit.edu/">MIT Senseable City Lab</a> and <a href="https://d-lab.mit.edu/">MIT D-Lab</a>, working on projects ranging from designing a sensor system to monitor vermifilter wastewater treatment systems in rural Colombia to developing deep learning models trained to detect and geo-reference informal water infrastructure using street-level imagery in Nigeria and the Philippines.</p>
            <p>You can learn more about my research projects on this <a href="https://neildpatel.github.io/research.html">page</a>.
            <h2>Groundwater Youth Network</h2>
            <p>I helped found <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/unesco-groundwater-youth-network">UNESCO’s Groundwater Youth Network</a> as a member of the inaugural steering committee, supporting research, career development, and capacity-building programs for a body of 2,000+ young water professionals representing 115+ countries. I have advocated for youth inclusion in the Sustainable Development Goals at the United Nations’ General Assembly and the High-Level Political Forum for Sustainable Development.</p>
