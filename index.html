            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I’m a water security, sanitation, and hygiene specialist at <a href="https://www.dai.com/our-work/solutions/environment-solutions/water-and-sanitation-services-and-resource-management">DAI</a> supporting a portfolio of USAID-funded WSSH programs around the world, primarily the <a href="https://www.globalwaters.org/HowWeWork/Activities/philippines-safe-water">USAID/Philippines Safe Water</a> and <a href="https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/haiti-usaid-water-and-sanitation-watsan">USAID/Haiti Eau</a> activities. I additionally provide short-term technical assistance as a WSSH specialist to a variety of water, biodiversity, and climate adaptation programs, including: <a href="https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/africa-trade-and-investment-ati-activity"> USAID Africa Trade & Investment</a>, <a href="https://www.globalwaters.org/HowWeWork/Activities/usaid-fragile-waters-activity">USAID Fragile Waters</a>, and <a href="https://www.gcbc.org.uk/">UK Global Centre on Biodiversity on Climate.</a> </p>
            <p>Prior to this role, I was the Project Analyst for <a href="https://www.globalwaters.org/wash-fin-2">USAID’s Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene Finance (WASH-FIN) 2</a>, where I led data analytics, monitoring, and impact evaluation efforts for a $73M program operating in ten countries (with primary operations in India, Kenya, Ghana, and Rwanda) to mobilize financing for climate resilient water and sanitation services. I also previously worked on <a href="https://www.globalwaters.org/wash-fin">USAID’s Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene Finance (WASH-FIN)</a> and <a href="https://www.globalwaters.org/HowWeWork/Activities/uganda-sanitation-health-activity">Uganda Sanitation for Health Activity (USHA)</a> activities.</p> 
            <p>I have a master’s degree in Data, Economics, and Development Policy from MIT, and an undergraduate degree in Business Honors & Plan II from the University of Texas at Austin. </p>
            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>My research primarily focuses on the use of geospatial AI to improve water security and access in urban areas. I was a research affiliate with the MIT <a href="https://senseable.mit.edu/">Senseable City Lab</a> and <a href="https://d-lab.mit.edu/">MIT D-Lab</a>, working on projects ranging from designing a sensor system to monitor vermifilter wastewater treatment systems in rural Colombia to developing deep learning models trained to detect and geo-reference water points using street-level imagery in Lagos. You can learn more about my projects on this <a href="neildpatel.github.io/projects">page</a>.
            <h2>Groundwater Youth Network</h2>
            <p>I’m passionate about youth representation in the water sector and represent North America on the global steering committee for <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/unesco-groundwater-youth-network">UNESCO’s Groundwater Youth Network</a>, supporting research, career development, and capacity-building programs for a body of 1,400+ young water professionals representing 114 countries. I have advocated for youth inclusion in the Sustainable Development Goals at the United Nations’ General Assembly and the High-Level Political Forum for Sustainable Development.</p>
