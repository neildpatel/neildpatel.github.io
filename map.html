                    I served as primary technical backstop to the El Salvador-based project team, working closely with the Chief of Party and Home Office Project Manager to provide regular technical quality control and review for project deliverables and supporting the project team in long-term strategic planning and implementation. 
                    I developed the project-wide Environmental Monitoring and Mitigation Plan (EMMP) and provided technical guidance on implementa-tion of environmental compliance reviews, monitoring, and reporting. I additionally coordinated workplan development for a $600K rehabilitation pilot of six pump stations servicing 31K people in the La Cima neighborhood of San Salvador to improve distribution efficiency and reduce energy/head loss. The pilot was intended to progress to a nationwide energy efficiency program financed via an ESCO prior to project cancellation</p>

                        <p style='font-size:12px;'>USAID’s Water Security and Systems Strengthening (USAID Eau) Activity provided technical support to Haiti’s water service providers and the Ministry of Environment’s Institute for Water Resources Management to strengthen institutional capacity and improve management of Haiti’s water resources.
                        USAID Eau supported the efforts of Haiti’s National Drinking Water and Sanitation Directorate (DINEPA) and its decentralized utilities to improve drinking water services for one million Haitians. The project provided technical assistance and support to DINEPA to develop clear standards for governance and transparency in the management of the local water systems;
                        assisted water utilities to improve their management of the water systems, responsibly manage the water resources, and advance on their path towards creditworthiness; solarized water systems to reduce reliance on expensive and unreliable energy sources; and
                        promoted gender and social inclusion to mitigate the adverse effects of poor water services and poor governance on women’s safety, health, and economic opportunity.
                        I served as primary technical backstop to the Haiti-based project team, working closely with the Chief of Party and Home Office Project Manager to provide regular technical quality control and review for project deliverables and supporting the project team in long-term strategic planning and implementation.</p>

                    <p style='font-size:12px;'>I was engaged by the USAID Fragile Waters activity to support USAID/Haiti in developing evidence-based toolkits to facilitate adaptive and concerted management of shared national and transboundary water resources. 
                        I collaborated with Northwater Consulting, USAID Eau, and USAID Fragile Waters leadership to develop a StoryMap that visualizes the connectivity of the watershed, rivers, and the aquifer, including outlining primary basins, recharge, and aquifer thickness. 
                        We additionally present high-resolution projections of population growth and water demand at the third administrative level to model future dependence on the aquifer by 2050 and inform tailored and localized management strategies. 
                        Finally, we outline emerging threats to the aquifer, including saltwater intrusion, climate change, contamination, and politicization of the Massacre River.
                        The StoryMap was presented at the 2024 UNC Water & Health Conference in coordination with key Haitian government stakeholders, including DINEPA, INARHy, and State University of Haiti's Center for Water Resilience.</p>

                    <p style='font-size:12px;'>Ciudad de México (CDMX) loses an estimated 40 percent of water to thousands of leaks emerging throughout its over 12,000 kilometres of piped infrastructure, half of which was built six decades ago. Navigating the interrelated challenges of leak detection, maintenance, and prevention requires a systems-based approach that harmonizes the efforts of the numerous stakeholders involved in managing the metropolitan area’s water infrastructure. 
                    This research explores three potential applications of the enhanced data integrity offered through blockchain to improving systems-based leak prevention in CDMX: (1) streamlining maintenance through smart contracts, (2) reducing diligence burdens for external financing, and (3) strengthening accountability mechanisms for equitable service provision. It was conducted with Prof. Jane Cohen at the University of Texas at Austin, and received support from the Inter-American Development Bank. </p>

                        Transform WASH, a $19M, five-year, project supported the development of the national and sub-national Mozambican WASH sector, increasing access to water services, and accelerating adoption of key hygiene behavior. Transform WASH worked collaboratively with the GRM and local water system operators to
                        strengthen policy implementation and institutional capacity to deliver WASH services, increase and sustain the availability of water infrastructure and services, improve access to private sector financing and business environments in the WASH service delivery chain, accelerate uptake and maintenance of key water and hygiene behaviors among households and institutions, and increase women’s leadership and household decision-making power for WASH products and services.
                        Transform WASH focuses on small towns, rural growth centers, and peri-urban settlements in Cabo Delgado, Nampula, and Zambezia provinces, while also enhancing the capacity of key national-level institutions. Tetra Tech is supporting policy reform, institutional capacity building for government partners, access to financing, and an improved business environment for private sector engagement. 
                        I provided start-up support to USAID/Mozambique’s Transform WASH, including developing the activity Environmental Mitigation and Monitoring Plan (EMMP) and Climate Risk Management Plan (CMRP) in compliance with USAID regulations.</p>

                    <p style='font-size:12px;'>Households in developing countries often rely on alternative shared water sources that exist outside of the datasets of public service providers. 
                        This poses a significant challenge to accurately measuring the number of households outside the public service system that use a safe and accessible water source. 
                        This paper proposes a novel deep learning approach that utilizes a convolutional neural network to detect water points in street-level imagery from Google Street View. 
                        Using a case study of the Agege local government area in Lagos, Nigeria, the model detected 36 previously unregistered water points across a variety of urban settings and obstruction levels with 94.7% precision. 
                        The paper was developed through the support of Prof. Carlo Ratti and the MIT Senseable City Lab and was published in the IWA peer-reviewed journal Water Practice and Technology.

                        Its activities include: (1) building the technical and managerial capacities of water service providers, emphasizing the application of water data and information to design, operate, and maintain resilient natural and built assets; (2) increasing planning and coordination among local, regional, and watershed stakeholders; and (3) improving the resilience of upstream water supplies through integrated water resources management and reducing the volume of downstream demand by building a constituency of water-wise households and businesses.
                        The project brought access to safe water and sanitation services to 1.1M and 480K people (respectively) in the most water-stressed regions of the Philippines. Project activities additionally led to 912K metric tons of sequestered GHG emissions, 93 service providers with improved capacity, and $82M in financing mobilized to the sector. 
                        I served as primary technical backstop to the Philippines-based project team, working closely with the Chief of Party and Home Office Project Manager to provide regular technical quality control and review for project deliverables and supporting the project team in long-term strategic planning and implementation.

However, full implementation of this right has been complicated by Tanzania’s ongoing decentralization process for water governance, which has created a significant public financing gap for cash-strapped rural water schemes. Under the framework of the progressive realization of the human right to water, my undergraduate thesis examined the potential for digital credit financing to bridge the public financing gap for rural water schemes in Tanzania. The thesis utilizes (1) country-wide data on digital financial inclusion and rural water access and (2) two case studies of digital credit financing in the rural water sector to explore the viability of a digital credit financing model. I conducted a month of fieldwork in Tanzania in January 2020 as part of this project.</p>

                        To address this situation, in January of 2018, the Government of Uganda (GoU), through the USAID Uganda Sanitation for Health Activity (USHA), began a 5-year, $32M collaboration with a consortium of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) experts to increase the number of people with access to improved and sustainable WASH services in 20 districts in Uganda. 
                        The project brought clean water and sanitation to 93K households and 820K people respectively, as well as certifying 1,900 communities as open defecation free.
                        As Deputy Project Manager, I led budget management, financial reporting, subcontractor management, and client engagement responsibilities to ensure timely and cost-efficient delivery of activity results.
